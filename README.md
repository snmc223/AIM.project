Code Louisville Project 2021

My project is based on a business website (original website: www.aimmailing.com). I talked to the owner about what he would change and he was very strict that he would not update their logo. So I designed my project around their current logo.

For my CSS features: (1) I incorporated a hamburger menu that expands and collapses at multiple screen sizes. (2) I created a flexbox grid to organize the 'How To Use' section (goes from a row to a column). (3) I added a loading spinner before the body of the website pulls up.

For my JavaScript features: (1) I added a Contact Form that captured the value of an email address and an alert displayed with 'Information Recieved'. If you enter nothing, an alert displayed 'Not a valid email'. (2) The collapsing menu is also used through JS to hide the menu elements by clicking the hamburger icon. (3) I've also added a required attribute with a 'for' loop for the rest of the input fields in the contact form.
