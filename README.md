Code Louisville Project 2021

My project is based on a business website (www.aimmailing.com). I talked to the owner about what he would change and he was very strict that he would not update their logo. So I designed my project around their current logo.

For my CSS features: (1) I incorporated a hamburger menu that expands and collapses at multiple screen sizes. (2) I created a flexbox grid to organize the 'How To Use' section (goes from a row to a column). (3) I added a loading spinner before the body of the website pulls up.

For my JavaScript features: (1) I added a Contact Form where you enter your email and an alert displays with 'Information Recieved'. If you enter nothing, an alert displays 'Not a valid email'. (2) The collapsing menu is also used through JS to hide the menu elements by clicking the hamburger icon. (3) I've also added a required attribute with a 'for' loop

 for the other fields of the contact form  also that displays an alert 'Please fill out all required fields.' if nothing is entered. If the correct fields are filled out, the alert reads 'Please fill out all required fields.'.
