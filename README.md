Code Louisville Project 2021

My project is based on my father's business website (www.aimmailing.com). I talked to him about what he would change and he was very strict that he would not change the logo. So I set out to design and implement a website for this project with his logo in mind. His website was already straight from the 90s and insanely busy, that I went the complete opposite direction. So overall this is a layout of a business website with a contact form.

For my CSS features, I incorporated a navigation menu that expands and collapses at multiple screen sizes, a flexbox grid to organize the 'How To Use' section (goes from a row to a column), and I added a loading spinner before the website pulls up.

For my JavaScript features, I added a Contact Form where you enter your email and an alert displays with 'Information Recieved'. If you enter nothing, an alert displays 'Not a valid email'. The collapsing menu is also used through JS to hide the menu elements by clicking the icon. I've also added a required feild for the contact form also that displays an alert 'Please fill out all required fields.' if nothing is entered. If the correct fields are filled out, the alert reads 'Please fill out all required fields.'.
